* Does information persist between page refreshes?
## Search Page
* Does the search page have a search input that lets users search for books?
* Do the search results allow a user to categorize a book as “currently reading”, “want to read”, or “read”?

## Routing
* Does the main page link to the search page?
* Does the search page link back to the main page?
## Code Functionality
* Does the project code handle state management appropriately?
* Does the code run without errors? Is the code free of warnings that resulted from not following the best practices listed in the documentation, such as using key for list items? Is the code formatted properly?
